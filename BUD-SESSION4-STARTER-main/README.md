# BLOCKCHAIN UNN - NFT preview card component solution

This is a solution to the NFT preview card component challenge for BUD session 4

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
1.A body elements was created and it serves as the background of the Nft Card.
2.Created a 'section' element inside the body to serve as the main Nft Card.
3.All other elements and images was nested inside the section(nft Card) using divs as containers
4.Selectors were used to target specific elements to to change thier properties and align them.


### Built with
