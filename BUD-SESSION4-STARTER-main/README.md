# BLOCKCHAIN UNN - NFT preview card component solution

This is a solution to the NFT preview card component challenge for BUD session 4

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

## My process
1.A body elements was created and it serves as the background of the Nft Card.
2.Created a 'section' element inside the body to serve as the main Nft Card.
3.All other elements and images was nested inside the section(nft Card) using divs as containers
4.Selectors were used to target specific elements to to change thier properties and align them.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This project broading my knowledge on both html semantics as well as css selectors,Resizing of images and icons and most importantly the use to display properties such as flex to help align and structure elements properly
